##Making a Beer Predictor using Machine Learning:  
  
-To better understand what qualities of a beer makes it good or bad, we studied and analyzed a dataset of over 1,500,000 beer reviews.   
-we used pattern recognition techniques to discovered few subjective features of a beer that has a strong influence on the overall rating of the beer (like Aroma, Taste, Appearance, Palate, etc.)  
-We trained and tested several predictive models based off Linear Regression Model, Ridge Regression Model, Lasso Regression Model, and Elastic Net Model.
